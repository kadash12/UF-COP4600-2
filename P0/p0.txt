							P0 Report
Synopsis:
	The goal of project 0 was to print a boot debug message in the kernel boot after the 
	“Freeing unused kernel image memory” messages. Before the start of the project, a “clean” 
	snapshot of the kernel from 5.0.21+ codebase was built by following the troubleshooting 
	directions. After modifying the kernel, the kernel was re-build and a screenshot of the 
	message was taken. The final task is to create a unified patch file and test it against 
	the clean snapshot to ensure that its function correctly, the message reappears after the 
	patch.

Description:
      The goal was achieved by searching for the hinted term “rcu_end_inkernel_boot()” using the 
	grep command in ubuntu kernel source (grep -ir "rcu_end_inkernel_boot()"). It was discovered 
	that it was only being actively used in the main.c file at /home/reptilian/src/linux-hwe-5.0.0/init 
	with no other files to choose from. After accessing the main.c for editing in nano, the hinted term was 
	searched using cltr-W. Then the boot message was coded with one new line above and below after the 
	hinted term line. This is seen below:
		pr_info(" ");
		pr_info("#### Johnny Li (UFID: 9699-4228) How I figured this out is a miracle. #####");
		pr_info(" ");

      The function pr_info was used to print the message as printf and printk gave me an error, noted in source 
	[1]. After restarting ubuntu and confirming that the debug boot message did appear with the virtual box
	screen capturing software, the command make && sudo make install && sudo make modules_install was called 
	in the /home/reptilian/linux-hwe-5.0.0 to ensure the changes were made.

      To create the patch, then I followed the given code in the project document: 
      	cd /usr/rep/src/linux-hwe-5.0.0 
      	git add -u 
      	git add '*.c' '*.h' '*Makefile*' '*.tbl' 
      	git diff master > p0.diff
      
	Note that the path remotes/origin/master did not work for me therefore I got around it with only the master.

      Then the patch was downloaded to my local storage by command prompt sftp [2] with the command sftp -P 9474 
	reptilian@localhost to access the kernel. I navigated to the directory with the patch and used command “get 
	p0.diff” to retrieve the patch. To test the patch, ubuntu was reverted to its clean snapshot and the local 
	patch was uploaded to the kernel by command prompt sftp again but with the command “put p0.diff”. I followed 
	the rest given code in the project document to install the patch with and rebooted in debug mode to confirm 
	that the boot message appeared again. The main portion of the project is therefore completed.
